title: When should you cite?
summary:
content: |
  In general, you should be citing at least once per paragraph you contribute to
  Wikipedia, but any quotations, hard facts (such as statistics) and
  controversial claims must be cited.

  Basically, whenever you add information to an article, be sure to include
  references.
