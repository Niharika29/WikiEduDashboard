title: Finding an image on Wikipedia
summary:
content: |
  The first step to adding an image to your Wikipedia article is finding one.
  Luckily, that’s quite easy using Visual Editor.

  Click “Edit” at the top of the screen. Then, click your cursor into the
  article wherever you’d like your image to appear. Then, choose “Insert” on the
  editing bar at the top of the screen. A few options will pop up. Choose “Media.”

  You’ll be presented with a search bar. You can use this bar to search images
  that are already prepared for you to use on Wikipedia. Try searching for a few
  different word combinations if it comes up blank. You could even try terms in
  other languages!

  Click to choose an image, and select “Use this image” on the top right. You’ll
  be prompted to write a description of the image as it relates to the content
  of your article. Once you insert it, you’ll be given a preview of how it will
  appear in the text. If it looks good to you, press “Save changes” and enter an
  edit summary. That’s it!
