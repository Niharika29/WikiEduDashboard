  On Wikipedia, the images you use must have a what's called a "free license".

  Anyone who creates a work is automatically the owner of its copyright, unless
  they produced it for an employer, or transferred their copyright to someone
  else. A free license is a kind of copyright license that says the creator will
  allow anyone to use their work (with some, or no, restrictions) without asking
  for permission. That makes it easier for others to use your work.

  Wikimedia Commons — the free media collection that Wikipedia draws from —
  defaults to what's called a "Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike"
  license.

  That means that anyone can:
  * Use it, copy it, share it
  * Modify it and share it as a new work

  As long as the person using it:
  * provides credit to the original author and notes the license (Attribution)
  * releases any modifications of the work under the same license (Share-Alike)
