title: Using CC Search
summary:
content: |
  Creative Commons is a non-profit that helps spread the word about free
  licenses. It's not actually connected to Wikipedia, but they've created a
  search engine that will help find materials that fit a certain type of license:
  CC Search. Let's look at how it works.

  First, go to <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">search.creativecommons.org</a>.

  Next to the green “CC Search” box, type in the topic of your search, just like
  you would any search engine. Beneath the search query, you MUST click the two
  boxes, “use for commercial purposes…” and “modify, adapt, build upon…”. If you
  do not click those two boxes, you may NOT be able to use the images you find
  through this search on Wikipedia.

  Click the boxes below the search box to choose which sites you want to search
  for Wikipedia-acceptable images.

  When you find an image, make a note. We’ll show you later on how to add that
  image to Wikimedia Commons, so you can include it in your Wikipedia article.
